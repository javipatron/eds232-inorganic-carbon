# eds232-inorganic-carbon



This lab will be using the knowledge of machine learning gained in my course to training models to predict dissolved inorganic carbon in water samples collected by the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations program (CalCOFI).  Some tasks are; explore the data, preprocessing, choose a model algorithm, tune relevant parameters with cross validation, and create my own prediction.
